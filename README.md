# Weather-prediction-for-Wids-2023-using-Ml-algos-LGBM-

The WIDS (Women in Data Science) competition by Stanford on Kaggle focuses on using machine learning algorithms for weather prediction. 
After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset, the team utilized decision tree, random forest, and LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) algorithms to make predictions. 
These algorithms use historical weather data and meteorological features to forecast future weather conditions, allowing for improved planning and preparedness in affected areas.
